# Py_Alarm
Trying to turn my Raspberry Pi into a music alarm

Forked this simple Python music playing code, currently works for Mac and Linux but I only need Linux.

Plans:

 - [x] Get a single song playing on my laptop
 - [ ] Get it to shuffle all songs in a folder
 - [ ] Get it wo work on the Raspberry Pi
 - [ ] Set up a `cron` job to activate it
 - [ ] Wake up to lovely tunes without annoying ads or self-centred radio DJs telling me about their lives when I'm trying to snooze.
