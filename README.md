# Py_Alarm
Trying to turn my Raspberry Pi into a music alarm

Forked this simple Python music playing code, currently works for Mac and Linux but I only need Linux.

Current aims:

 - [x] Get a single song playing on my laptop
 - [ ] Get it to shuffle all songs in a folder
 - [ ] Get the Raspberry Pi to acually boot (having problems at the mo)
 - [ ] Get the Python script to work on the Raspberry Pi and play a song to plugged in speakers
 - [ ] Set up a `cron` job to activate it in the mornings
 - [ ] Wake up to lovely tunes without annoying ads or self-centred radio DJs telling me about their lives when I'm trying to snooze.

Future plans:
- [ ] Get it to connect to speakers over bluetooth
- [ ] Add voice commands to snooze/change volume/skip a song
- [ ] Try to make it able to switch speakers from bedroom to living room?
